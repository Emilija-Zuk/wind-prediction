# Wind Prediction

A modern React web application that uses AI and machine learning to predict wind patterns and speeds. This project builds upon the WindAI foundation with a proper React project setup, advanced forecasting capabilities, and intelligent wind prediction algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Wind Predictions:**  
  Machine learning models to forecast wind speed and direction based on historical data and weather patterns.

- **Modern React Architecture:**  
  Built with Create React App or Vite, featuring component-based architecture and modern React hooks.

- **Interactive Data Visualization:**  
  Advanced charts and maps showing current conditions, historical trends, and future predictions.

- **Real-time Updates:**  
  Live wind data integration with automatic forecast updates.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Mobile-first approach with a clean, modern UI/UX.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Chart.js/D3.js, CSS Modules/Styled Components
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow.js, Python (scikit-learn, pandas), REST APIs
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express or Python Flask/FastAPI
- **Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3) or similar
- **Build Tools:** Vite/Webpack, ESLint, Prettier

## 📋 Project Status

🚧 **Currently in development** - This is an evolution of the WindAI project with focus on:
- Proper React project structure and modern tooling
- Machine learning integration for accurate wind predictions
- Enhanced user experience and data visualization
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Accurate Predictions:** Implement ML algorithms to provide reliable wind forecasts
2. **User Experience:** Create an intuitive interface for viewing wind data and predictions
3. **Performance:** Optimize for fast loading and smooth interactions
4. **Scalability:** Design architecture to handle multiple locations and extended forecasts
