            <strong>Wind Prediction</strong> gives short-range wind guidance for the <strong>Gold Coast</strong> so kitesurfers and surfers can plan with more confidence. Public forecasts are useful, but they can miss local effects. This tool focuses on the next few hours at beach level.
          </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses supervised <strong> machine-learning models</strong> trained on historical weather data.</li>
          <li>Blends those models with <strong>live station feeds</strong> (wind speed, gusts, direction, pressure, temperature).</li>
          <li>Looks for upstream signals and short-term patterns to infer what comes next.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Example: rising wind in Byron Bay often arrives on the Gold Coast shortly after - the system learns and tracks that relationship.
        </p>

        <h2>Update cycle</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Full model retrain</strong> every few hours - deep learning.</li>
          <li><strong>On-demand quick updates</strong> when a user requests a fresh run on the Predictions page.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why it helps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasizes <strong>short-range forecasting</strong> (the next 1â€“3 hours), not just daily forecasts.</li>
          <li>Adjusts quickly to <strong>real observations</strong>, reducing the chance of driving to the spot only to find the wind has dropped.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scalable design</h2>
        <p>
          The same pipeline can be deployed to additional stations across Queensland and beyond with minimal setup.
